# Folder Structure
1. Work in the src/components directory. Here, you shall chew on the main component, Aps.js, which shal render all the other components.
1. Build out your features in the src/components/ directory.
1. All image resource will be two steps ahead in assets/images folder.
1. All stylesheets will be a step ahead in assets/stylesheets folder.
- This is the folder structure of the project...

# Work In Progress
1. I have implemented some shallow JSX representation structure of how the footer will look like.
1. This shall later be restructured to allow react routing to the given pages in the event of links, and send message to the backend in the event of feedback.
2. Feel free to add any visual improvements or code modifications to this boiler plate code

-This is the footer phase of the project...
